<h1>Optimization considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#optimization-considerations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The performance of bisa as an analysis tool or emulator is greatly handicapped
by the fact that lots of it is written in Python. Regardless, there are a lot of
optimizations and tweaks you can use to make bisa faster and lighter.</p>
<section id="general-speed-tips">
<h2>General speed tips<a class="headerlink" href="#general-speed-tips" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Use pypy</em>. <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/">Pypy</a> is an alternate Python interpreter that
performs optimized jitting of Python code. In our tests, it’s a 10x speedup
out of the box.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Only use the SimEngine mixins that you need</em>. SimEngine uses a mixin model
which allows you to add and remove features by constructing new classes. The
default engine mixes in every possible features, and the consequence of that
is that it is slower than it needs to be. Look at the definition for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UberEngine</span></code> (the default SimEngine), copy its declaration, and remove all
the base classes which provide features you don’t need.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Don’t load shared libraries unless you need them</em>. The default setting in
bisa is to try at all costs to find shared libraries that are compatible with
the binary you’ve loaded, including loading them straight out of your OS
libraries. This can complicate things in a lot of scenarios. If you’re
performing an analysis that’s anything more abstract than bare-bones symbolic
execution, ESPECIALLY control-flow graph construction, you might want to make
the tradeoff of sacrificing accuracy for tractability. bisa does a reasonable
job of making sane things happen when library calls to functions that don’t
exist try to happen.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use hooking and SimProcedures</em>. If you’re enabling shared libraries, then you
definitely want to have SimProcedures written for any complicated library
function you’re jumping into. If there’s no autonomy requirement for this
project, you can often isolate individual problem spots where analysis hangs
up and summarize them with a hook.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use SimInspect</em>. <a class="reference internal" href="../core-concepts/simulation.html#breakpoints"><span class="std std-ref">SimInspect</span></a> is the most underused and
one of the most powerful features of bisa. You can hook and modify almost any
behavior of bisa, including memory index resolution (which is often the
slowest part of any bisa analysis).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Write a concretization strategy</em>. A more powerful solution to the problem of
memory index resolution is a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bisa/bisa/tree/master/bisa/concretization_strategies">concretization strategy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use the Replacement Solver</em>. You can enable it with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bisa.options.REPLACEMENT_SOLVER</span></code> state option. The replacement solver
allows you to specify AST replacements that are applied at solve-time. If you
add replacements so that all symbolic data is replaced with concrete data when
it comes time to do the solve, the runtime is greatly reduced. The API for
adding a replacement is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.se._solver.add_replacement(old,</span> <span class="pre">new)</span></code>. The
replacement solver is a bit finicky, so there are some gotchas, but it’ll
definitely help.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>If you’re performing lots of concrete or partially-concrete execution<a class="headerlink" href="#if-you-re-performing-lots-of-concrete-or-partially-concrete-execution" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Use the unicorn engine</em>. If you have <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/">unicorn engine</a> installed, bisa can be built to
take advantage of it for concrete emulation. To enable it, add the options in
the set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bisa.options.unicorn</span></code> to your state. Keep in mind that while most
items under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bisa.options</span></code> are individual options, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bisa.options.unicorn</span></code>
is a bundle of options, and is thus a set. <em>NOTE</em>: At time of writing the
official version of unicorn engine will not work with bisa - we have a lot of
patches to it to make it work well with bisa. They’re all pending pull
requests at this time, so sit tight. If you’re really impatient, ping us about
uploading our fork!</p></li>
<li><p><em>Enable fast memory and fast registers</em>. The state options
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bisa.options.FAST_MEMORY</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bisa.options.FAST_REGISTERS</span></code> will do this.
These will switch the memory/registers over to a less intensive memory model
that sacrifices accuracy for speed. TODO: document the specific sacrifices.
Should be safe for mostly concrete access though. NOTE: not compatible with
concretization strategies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Concretize your input ahead of time</em>. This is the approach taken by <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/publications/2016_NDSS_Driller.pdf">driller</a>.
When creating a state with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">entry_state</span></code> or the like, you can create a
SimFile filled with symbolic data, pass it to the initialization function as
an argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">entry_state(...,</span> <span class="pre">stdin=my_simfile)</span></code>, and then constrain the
symbolic data in the SimFile to what you want the input to be. If you don’t
require any tracking of the data coming from stdin, you can forego the
symbolic part and just fill it with concrete data. If there are other sources
of input besides standard input, do the same for those.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use the afterburner</em>. While using unicorn, if you add the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UNICORN_THRESHOLD_CONCRETIZATION</span></code> state option, bisa will accept thresholds
after which it causes symbolic values to be concretized so that execution can
spend more time in Unicorn. Specifically, the following thresholds exist:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.unicorn.concretization_threshold_memory</span></code> - this is the number of
times a symbolic variable, stored in memory, is allowed to kick execution
out of Unicorn before it is forcefully concretized and forced into Unicorn
anyways.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.unicorn.concretization_threshold_registers</span></code> - this is the number of
times a symbolic variable, stored in a register, is allowed to kick
execution out of Unicorn before it is forcefully concretized and forced into
Unicorn anyways.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.unicorn.concretization_threshold_instruction</span></code> - this is the number
of times that any given instruction can force execution out of Unicorn (by
running into symbolic data) before any symbolic data encountered at that
instruction is concretized to force execution into Unicorn.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get further control of what is and isn’t concretized with the
following sets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.unicorn.always_concretize</span></code> - a set of variable names that will
always be concretized to force execution into unicorn (in fact, the memory
and register thresholds just end up causing variables to be added to this
list).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.unicorn.never_concretize</span></code> - a set of variable names that will never
be concretized and forced into Unicorn under any condition.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.unicorn.concretize_at</span></code> - a set of instruction addresses at which
data should be concretized and forced into Unicorn. The instruction
threshold causes addresses to be added to this set.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once something is concretized with the afterburner, you will lose track of
that variable. The state will still be consistent, but you’ll lose
dependencies, as the stuff that comes out of Unicorn is just concrete bits
with no memory of what variables they came from. Still, this might be worth it
for the speed in some cases, if you know what you want to (or do not want to)
concretize.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section id="memory-optimization">
<h2>Memory optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-optimization" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The golden rule for memory optimization is to make sure you’re not keeping any
references to data you don’t care about anymore, especially related to states
which have been left behind. If you find yourself running out of memory during
analysis, the first thing you want to do is make sure you haven’t caused a state
explosion, meaning that the analysis is accumulating program states too quickly.
If the state count is in control, then you can start looking for reference
leaks. A good tool to do this with is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rhelmot/dumpsterdiver">https://github.com/rhelmot/dumpsterdiver</a>,
which gives you an interactive prompt for exploring the reference graph of a
Python process.</p>
<p>One specific consideration that should be made when analyzing programs with very
long paths is that the state history is designed to accumulate data infinitely.
This is less of a problem than it could be because the data is stored in a smart
tree structure and never copied, but it will accumulate infinitely. To downsize
a state’s history and free all data related to old steps, call
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.history.trim()</span></code>.</p>
<p>One <em>particularly</em> problematic member of the history dataset is the basic block
trace and the stack pointer trace. When using unicorn engine, these lists of
ints can become huge very very quickly. To disable unicorn’s capture of ip and
sp data, remove the state options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UNICORN_TRACK_BBL_ADDRS</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UNICORN_TRACK_STACK_POINTERS</span></code>.</p>
