<h1>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This is a collection of commonly-asked “how do I do X?” questions and other
general questions about bisa, for those too lazy to read this whole document.</p>
<p>If your question is of the form “how do I fix X issue after installing”, see
also the Troubleshooting section of the <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">:ref:`install instructions &lt;Installing
bisa&gt;`_</span></a>.</p>
<section id="why-is-it-named-bisa">
<h2>Why is it named bisa?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-it-named-bisa" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The core of bisa’s analysis is on VEX IR, and when something is vexing, it makes
you bisay.</p>

<section id="how-should-bisa-be-stylized">
<h2>How should “bisa” be stylized?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-should-bisa-be-stylized" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>All lowercase, even at the beginning of sentences. It’s an anti-proper noun.</p>

<section id="why-isn-t-symbolic-execution-doing-the-thing-i-want">
<h2>Why isn’t symbolic execution doing the thing I want?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-isn-t-symbolic-execution-doing-the-thing-i-want" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The universal debugging technique for symbolic execution is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Check your simulation manager for errored states. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(simgr)</span></code> is a good
place to start, and if you see anything to do with “errored”, go for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(simgr.errored)</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have any errored states and it’s not immediately obvious what you did
wrong, you can get a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">pdb</a> shell
at the crash site by going <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simgr.errored[n].debug()</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If no state has reached an address you care about, you should check the path
each state has gone down: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">pprint;</span>
<span class="pre">pprint.pprint(state.history.descriptions.hardcopy)</span></code>. This will show you a
high-level summary of what the symbolic execution engine did at each step
along the state’s history. You will be able to see from this a basic block
trace and also a list of executed simprocedures. If you’re using unicorn
engine, you can check <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.history.bbl_addrs.hardcopy</span></code> to see what blocks
were executed in each invocation of unicorn.</p></li>
<li><p>If a state is going down the wrong path, you can check what constraints caused
it to go that way: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(state.solver.constraints)</span></code>. If a state has just
gone past a branch, you can check the most recent branch condition with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.history.events[-1]</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="how-can-i-get-diagnostic-information-about-what-bisa-is-doing">
<h2>How can I get diagnostic information about what bisa is doing?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-i-get-diagnostic-information-about-what-bisa-is-doing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>bisa uses the standard <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">logging</span></code> module for logging, with every package and
submodule creating a new logger.</p>
<p>The simplest way to get debug output is the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">logging</span>
<span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getLogger</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;bisa&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setLevel</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;DEBUG&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You may want to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INFO</span></code> or whatever else instead. By default, bisa will
enable logging at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code> level.</p>
<p>Each bisa module has its own logger string, usually all the Python modules above
it in the hierarchy, plus itself, joined with dots. For example,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bisa.analyses.cfg</span></code>. Because of the way the Python logging module works, you
can set the verbosity for all submodules in a module by setting a verbosity
level for the parent module. For example,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">logging.getLogger('bisa.analyses').setLevel('INFO')</span></code> will make the CFG, as
well as all other analyses, log at the INFO level.</p>

<section id="how-do-i-find-bugs-using-bisa">
<h2>How do I find bugs using bisa?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-find-bugs-using-bisa" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>It’s complicated! The easiest way to do this is to define a “bug condition”, for
example, “the instruction pointer has become a symbolic variable”, and run
symbolic exploration until you find a state matching that condition, then dump
the input as a testcase. However, you will quickly run into the state explosion
problem. How you address this is up to you. Your solution may be as simple as
adding an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">avoid</span></code> condition or as complicated as implementing CMU’s MAYHEM
system as an Exploration Technique.</p>

<section id="why-did-you-choose-vex-instead-of-another-ir-such-as-llvm-reil-bap-etc">
<h2>Why did you choose VEX instead of another IR (such as LLVM, REIL, BAP, etc)?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-did-you-choose-vex-instead-of-another-ir-such-as-llvm-reil-bap-etc" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We had two design goals in bisa that influenced this choice:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>bisa needed to be able to analyze binaries from multiple architectures. This
mandated the use of an IR to preserve our sanity, and required the IR to
support many architectures.</p></li>
<li><p>We wanted to implement a binary analysis engine, not a binary lifter. Many
projects start and end with the implementation of a lifter, which is a time
consuming process. We needed to take something that existed and already
supported the lifting of multiple architectures.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Searching around the internet, the major choices were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>LLVM is an obvious first candidate, but lifting binary code to LLVM cleanly is
a pain. The two solutions are either lifting to LLVM through QEMU, which is
hackish (and the only implementation of it seems very tightly integrated into
S2E), or McSema, which only supported x86 at the time but has since gone
through a rewrite and gotten support for x86-64 and aarch64.</p></li>
<li><p>TCG is QEMU’s IR, but extracting it seems very daunting as well and
documentation is very scarce.</p></li>
<li><p>REIL seems promising, but there is no standard reference implementation that
supports all the architectures that we wanted. It seems like a nice academic
work, but to use it, we would have to implement our own lifters, which we
wanted to avoid.</p></li>
<li><p>BAP was another possibility. When we started work on bisa, BAP only supported
lifting x86 code, and up-to-date versions of BAP were only available to
academic collaborators of the BAP authors. These were two deal-breakers. BAP
has since become open, but it still only supports x86_64, x86, and ARM.</p></li>
<li><p>VEX was the only choice that offered an open library and support for many
architectures. As a bonus, it is very well documented and designed
specifically for program analysis, making it very easy to use in bisa.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While bisa uses VEX now, there’s no fundamental reason that multiple IRs cannot
be used. There are two parts of bisa, outside of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bisa.engines.vex</span></code>
package, that are VEX-specific:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the jump labels (i.e., the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ijk_Ret</span></code> for returns, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ijk_Call</span></code> for calls,
and so forth) are VEX enums.</p></li>
<li><p>VEX treats registers as a memory space, and so does bisa. While we provide
accesses to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.regs.rax</span></code> and friends, on the backend, this does
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.registers.load(8,</span> <span class="pre">8)</span></code>, where the first <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">8</span></code> is a VEX-defined offset
for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rax</span></code> to the register file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To support multiple IRs, we’ll either want to abstract these things or translate
their labels to VEX analogues.</p>

<section id="why-are-some-arm-addresses-off-by-one">
<h2>Why are some ARM addresses off-by-one?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-some-arm-addresses-off-by-one" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to encode THUMB-ness of an ARM code address, we set the lowest bit to
one. This convention comes from LibVEX, and is not entirely our choice! If you
see an odd ARM address, that just means the code at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">address</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> is in THUMB
mode.</p>

<h2>How do I serialize bisa objects?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-serialize-bisa-objects" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html">Pickle</a> will work. However,
Python will default to using an extremely old pickle protocol that does not
support more complex Python data structures, so you must specify a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format">more
advanced data stream format</a>. The
easiest way to do this is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pickle.dumps(obj,</span> <span class="pre">-1)</span></code>.</p>

<section id="what-does-unsupportediroperror-floating-point-support-disabled-mean">
<h2>What does <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnsupportedIROpError(&quot;floating</span> <span class="pre">point</span> <span class="pre">support</span> <span class="pre">disabled&quot;)</span></code> mean?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-unsupportediroperror-floating-point-support-disabled-mean" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This might crop up if you’re using a CGC analysis such as driller or rex.
Floating point support in bisa has been disabled in the CGC analyses for a
tight-knit nebula of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Libvex’s representation of floating point numbers is imprecise - it converts
the 80-bit extended precision format used by the x87 for computation to 64-bit
doubles, making it impossible to get precise results</p></li>
<li><p>There is very limited implementation support in bisa for the actual primitive
operations themselves as reported by libvex, so you will often get a less
friendly “unsupported operation” error if you go too much further</p></li>
<li><p>For what operations are implemented, the basic optimizations that allow
tractability during symbolic computation (AST deduplication, operation
collapsing) are not implemented for floating point ops, leading to gigantic
ASTs</p></li>
<li><p>There are memory corruption bugs in z3 that get triggered frighteningly easily
when you’re using huge workloads of mixed floating point and bitvector ops. We
haven’t been able to get a testcase that doesn’t involve “just run bisa” for
the z3 guys to investigate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of trying to cope with all of these, we have simply disabled floating
point support in the symbolic execution engine. To allow for execution in the
presence of floating point ops, we have enabled an exploration technique called
the
<cite>https://github.com/bisa/bisa/blob/master/bisa/exploration_techniques/oppologist.py
&lt;oppologist&gt;</cite> that is supposed to catch these issues, concretize their inputs,
and run the problematic instructions through qemu via unicorn engine, allowing
execution to continue. The intuition is that the specific values of floating
point operations don’t typically affect the exploitation process.</p>
<p>If you’re seeing this error and it’s terminating the analysis, it’s probably
because you don’t have unicorn installed or configured correctly. If you’re
seeing this issue just in a log somewhere, it’s just the oppologist kicking in
and you have nothing to worry about.</p>

<section id="why-is-bisa-s-cfg-different-from-ida-s">
<h2>Why is bisa’s CFG different from IDA’s?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-bisa-s-cfg-different-from-ida-s" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Two main reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>IDA does not split basic blocks at function calls. bisa will, because they are
a form of control flow and basic blocks end at control flow instructions. You
generally do not need the supergraph for performing automated analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>IDA will split basic blocks if another block jumps into the middle of it. This
is called basic block normalization, and bisa does not do it by default since
it is unnecessary for most static analyses. You may enable it by passing
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">normalize=True</span></code> to the CFG analysis.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="why-do-i-get-incorrect-register-values-when-reading-from-a-state-during-a-siminspect-breakpoint">
<h2>Why do I get incorrect register values when reading from a state during a SimInspect breakpoint?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-i-get-incorrect-register-values-when-reading-from-a-state-during-a-siminspect-breakpoint" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>libVEX will eliminate duplicate register writes within a single basic block when
optimizations are enabled. Turn off IR optimization to make everything look
right at all times.</p>
<p>In the case of the instruction pointer, libVEX will frequently omit mid-block
writes even when optimizations are disabled. In this case, you should use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">state.scratch.ins_addr</span></code> to get the current instruction pointer.</p>
